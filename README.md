A small example of using [oto](https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto) for RPC code generation.

## Installation

```
go install github.com/peterhellberg/kop/cmd/...@latest
```

## Usage

Run `kop-server` in one terminal (this will by default start a web server on `localhost:12432`)

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the `PORT` for `kop-server`, then you will have to set the `KOP_PORT` variable accordingly.

Then run `kop Eggs Milk Flour` to create an initial list using the command line interface.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you speak Swedish, then you will want to `alias k√∂p='kop'` (and if not, then you might want to `alias buy='kop'`)

## Definitions

The definitions for the RPC server are found in [definitions/definitions.go](definitions/definitions.go)
