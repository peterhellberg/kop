# K√∂p üìù

A small example of using [oto](https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto) for RPC code generation.

## Installation

```
go install github.com/peterhellberg/kop/cmd/...@latest
```

## Usage

Run `kop-server` in one terminal (this will by default start a web server on `localhost:12432`)

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the `PORT` for `kop-server`, then you will have to set the `KOP_ENDPOINT` variable accordingly.
>
> (Default is `http://localhost:12432/rpc/`)

Then run `kop Eggs Milk Flour` to create an initial list using the command line interface.

```md
 - EGGS
 - FLOUR
 - MILK
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you speak Swedish, then you will want to `alias k√∂p='kop'` (and if not, then you might want to `alias buy='kop'`)

You can then remove an item from the list by calling `kop no Eggs`

```md
 - FLOUR
 - MILK
```

If you do not want to use the cli then you can use [cURL](https://curl.se) directly

```sh
curl -d '{}' http://localhost:12432/rpc/List.Items
```
```json
{
  "items": [
    "FLOUR",
    "MILK"
  ]
}
```

And even add something else to the list üç∫

```sh
curl -d '{"items": ["Beer"]}' http://localhost:12432/rpc/List.Add
```
```json
{
  "items": [
    "BEER",
    "FLOUR",
    "MILK"
  ]
}
```
